This shift in concentration dynamics may indicate different phases or factors influencing the penicillin production process. Further analysis and investigation would be valuable to understand the underlying factors contributing to these concentration changes.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Separating variables into categorical and continous based on their observations for better analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"categorical_features = []\nmid_categories = []\ncontinous_features = []\n\nfor feature in batch_29_df:\n    unique_count = len(batch_29_df[feature].unique())\n    \n    if unique_count <= 10:\n        categorical_features.append(feature)\n    elif 10 < unique_count < 30:\n        mid_categories.append(feature)\n    else:\n        continous_features.append(feature)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#categorical features\n# Initialize a counter\ncount = 1\n\n# Print categorical features with numbering\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    print(f\"{count}. {feature} : {batch_29_df[feature].unique()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    # Increment the counter\n    count += 1","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# mid_categories features\n# Initialize a counter\ncount = 1\n\n# Print mid_categories features with numbering\nfor feature in mid_categories:\n    print(f\"{count}. {feature} : {batch_29_df[feature].nunique()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    # Increment the counter\n    count += 1","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# continous_features\n# Initialize a counter\ncount = 1\n\n# Print ccontinous_features with numbering\nfor feature in continous_features:\n    print(f\"{count}. {feature} : {batch_29_df[feature].nunique()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    # Increment the counter\n    count += 1","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Print categorical features with numbering\nfor feature in categorical_features:\n    print(f\"{batch_29_df[feature].value_counts()}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# value counts percentages in categorical features\nmpl_palette_name = 'Dark2'\n\n# Increase the figure size\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 12))\n\nfor i, feature in enumerate(categorical_features):\n    # Adjust the subplot layout for better readability\n    plt.subplot(4, 3, i + 1)\n\n    bars = batch_29_df[feature].value_counts()\n    colors = sns.palettes.mpl_palette(mpl_palette_name, len(bars))\n\n    plt.pie(bars.values, labels=bars.index, colors=colors, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=40)\n    plt.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that the pie is drawn as a circle.\n\n    plt.title(\"{}\".format(feature))\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a 5x5 grid of subplots with improved spacing\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(16, 6))\nfig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4, wspace=0.5)\n\n# Flatten the axes array for easy iteration\naxes = axes.ravel()\n\n# Plot countplots for each variable in batch_29_df\nfor i, var in enumerate(categorical_features):\n    # Create subplots\n    ax = axes[i]\n\n    # Plot the countplot for the categorical variable\n    sns.countplot(data=batch_29_df, x=var, ax=ax)\n    ax.grid(True)\n    ax.set_xlabel(var)\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\n\n# Hide any remaining empty subplots\nfor i in range(len(categorical_features), len(axes)):\n    axes[i].axis('off')\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style= \"color:blue\">**Observation**</span>\n\nBased on the categorical features and their value counts, here are the observations:\n\n- **Aeration rate (Fg:L/h):** Aeration rates vary, with 75 L/h being the most common (550 occurrences), followed by 60 L/h (450 occurrences), 65 L/h (250 occurrences), and others.
